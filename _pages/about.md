Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto working on robotics and applied mathematics.
I am affiliated with the [Autonomous Space Robotics Lab (ASRL)](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/), working on state estimation for intelligent vehicles.

I got my Ph.D. from [Universit√© Clermont Auvergne (UCA)](https://www.uca.fr/) and [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en), where I worked with the [Institut Pascal](http://www.institutpascal.uca.fr/index.php/en/) and the [Northern Robotics Laboratory](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/) on risk-aware navigation algorithms.
This work was awarded the second prize for the [best french Ph.D. thesis in robotics](https://www.gdr-robotique.org/prix_de_these/?an=2021).

My research interests are broad and extend from applied mathematics to field robotics.
I am currently focusing on working with Lie groups for more accurate state estimation in the context of intelligent vehicles.
