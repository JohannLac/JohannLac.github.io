This project is one of my main focus at the [Autonomous Space Robotics Laboratory](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/)
Using modern mathematical tools such as Lie groups and Gaussian processes, we achieve great localization precision.

A core sensor we are using is a lidar that is also equipped with Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology, thus being able to also sense the radial velocity.
Using this new information, we can create a super fast and precise odometry for the vehicle!
