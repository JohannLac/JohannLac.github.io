This project is the main goal of [Northern Robotics Laboratory](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/): given a very cold, harsh weather, how can a robot still complete its task?

To this end, analysis have been made on the modeling of robot's motions on the snow, and expensive experiments have been done in a subarctic forest in the north of Quebec, Canada.

During these deployments, it has been made clear that navigation in unstructured environment remain an open challenge, from long-term map maintenance to failure recovery.
