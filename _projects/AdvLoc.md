This project is my core project at the [Autonomous Space Robotics Laboratory](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/)
Nowadays, we have strong localization algorithms but little guaranties about their robustness against faulty or missing measurements.
For instance, what happens if some part of the lidar sensor is frozen? What about strong snowstorm that return numerous measurements that cannot follow a zero-mean distribution error?

We work toward certifying the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for self-driving, under missing or faulty measurements.
